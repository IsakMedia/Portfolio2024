*did the original design in figma, strongly based (copied) from old Mac OS 9 i grew up with. 


used chatGPT to ask about BEM since i get confused on how long the class names are suppose to be, how far nested?
used chatGPT to get mediequeries for mobile first because i forgot the syntax.
used chatGPT to properly use flex grow/shrink to get right element to resize
