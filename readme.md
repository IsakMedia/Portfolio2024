# Steps im doing in development

## helpers

* figma
* chatgpt
* <https://box-shadow.dev/>
* <https://www.cdnfonts.com/chicago-2.font>;
* mac os 9 reference - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxdjhi53B8U>
* can i keep using scss for webcomponents?
<https://dev.to/m4thieulavoie/how-i-managed-to-use-scss-inside-web-components-3lk9>
<https://medium.com/swlh/web-components-with-shadow-dom-and-sass-f780ad23dd90>

* Did the original design in figma, strongly based (copied) from old Mac OS 9 i grew up with.  

* I need to rethink my BEM-classes again, should i think more in components?
should i start to try to make em right away before it goes too far. or do everything first.
probably not the latter. ill get to it soon

* setting up and watching sass on my laptop created a style.min.css and was dependent on it to read the scss in
index.html. wonder if im using different extensions or whats up. this might be a somewhat inconvenience when
switching between computers. so maybe i solve this some day. Anyways something to remember, to save myself from frustration.

* maybe i cant use scss as i want to, or webcomponents. im not sure yet. I really didnt want to use any npm packages for this project, keeping everything as "vanilla" as possible (except for sass, gotta have sass). Maybe this project will get me closer to understand the usefullness of bundlers and maybe wth webpack is?

* can i go over my shadow dom and check if it contains any <img> tags, to add a default alt="", property. Or makes it more sense to find a way to force who ever (me proably) who want to use my web-component to add an alt="" if they want to
include an <img> or <svg>

## What am i using ChatGPT for?

* used chatGPT to ask about BEM since i get confused on how long the class names are suppose to be, how far nested?
* used chatGPT to get mediequeries for mobile first because i forgot the syntax.
* used chatGPT to properly use flex grow/shrink to get right element to resize
* using chatGPT a lot to get all the values for a property,i understand it better than MDN.
* asked the bot how to properly set flex on children to make em take up equal amount of space of its container
* still struggling with flexbox flex growth. also asked it to do some math even though i know LLMs do math bad
but i figuer that LLMs might be able to give me the formula to solve it, and then i can ask (or figuer out)
the proper way to solve it somewhere else.
* As i hard code in my about text i asked the bot to help me place <p> tags where ever it felt it should be
a little breathers in my text.
* my html didnt work, hard to look at my tiny screen figuering out want tags has been closed off or missing its closing tag and so on. the Bot solves it

[edit: i left this long ago. chatGPT is help and a curse, claude is cool too, i use em for everything sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt]

## ideas

* could i do a vanilla js webcomponent?

* can i get the rearange feature in the bottom right of the window, but only on desktop.
im guessing i need to do some x-pos y-pos with javascript to drag em around. should it push the other content
or should it overlap. i need to think about it.
id really like if one feature would be that if you expand one of the windows, ive hidden easter eggs off screen.

* should the expand button make the window collapse at place itself on top of upper window?
* should it work by placing it with position:relative top:0, or do i have to use javascript to find the lower boundingrect?

* should add a margin of error for my jokes to multiply with. Maybe
it aint that funny even though i think it for the moment. i wonder if there are
any humor calculators out there. maybe i can run it on my page aswell. yeah ok
maybe not, but id like to have some dynamic text content from an open api.
hmm, dont know if i want it to be hidden or in the source-code just like an easter eggs. i do love easter eggs.
 (update) i do not remember what i mean by this anymore. but i do like dynamic content. so i agree with myself there.

### what am i doing?

* realizing how much i like typescript with all those mental gymnastics im doing

* realizing the important of planning what you want your components to do before you stir sh*t up.

* why am i like this?

* what an absolute nightmare this has become
-i need to blame someone..or something.. yooohooo chatGPT, whats up little buddy?
-it told me ive missunderstood everything.
-thanks obama.
-^ is that still a meme people remembers?
-anyways, next time i wont do the css first, or ill google before hand if sass could be a problem
-are you trying to blame sass for this?
-i guess.

* throw out everything, start over. simple down the components.
-havent figuered out if there is a limitation in web-components making it hard to put a component inside another component or if i just dont understand basic JS.
 anyways. time to push for deployment, and update stuff later

## if attribute is added. example "image-box"

attributeChangeCallback(name, oldVal, newVal){
    if(newVal ==="null") {
        // if theres no attribute named "img" it will return "null"
        so if null, do nothing.
    } else {
        // if added, get reference to instance of class, look for attribute "src"
        const newImg = document.createElement("img")
        newImg.setAttribute("img", value)
        // maybe i need to use this. here to get the current value of components img attribute
    }
}

<window-mac img="./isak.jpg">

setAttribute

img.setAttribute gives the element an attribute either way.
getAttribute gets the value of an attribute. if theres no attribute of said name, it returns null

maybe by moving   imageBoxTemp.content.cloneNode(true); and attach it to empty divs in windowsTemp
i can create a condition to render it. and it maybe should be placed within a livescycle method in web components
to render in at different times with different conditions met. but this messes with scope. so look into it.
maybe do as claude suggested and make a loop to get a hold of all gets and sets. think about it will ya

realizes that my component in a way works as expected, though ive forgotten how things work. i also realize that claude is right in a lot of ways but also the more i use AI to help me with logic, the further from god i walk. AI is great to help me with approaches to solvING problems but not so good at fixing them. Because it have its own idea on how to fix things, and not stringent with how i want to fix it. It's good in a way to figuer out the limitations of AI or maybe even more, the limitations of me, my journey or my comprehension of code in relation to AI.
Like theres a sub-journey for trying to become a more profficient AI-web-developer.
Anyways need to fix the bug of re-renders that mess with get and set attributes or observedAttributes that triggers a rerender and cleanup of the whole document. so execution order

16/8
if this.render() is run in the constructor (opposed to in a connectedcallback) it renderes all versions of my component
with text, with text and image, with only image. the subheading works but not the heading ?!
is a it a slot prob?

theres something about using attributes that messes with things, if i have both heading and subheading it only set the latter, if i only have a heading it works. now what in the

23/8
what ive learned from this ordeal. architecture is hard, doing css first is terrible, reinventing the wheel helps you learn stuff, but maybe not things you need. when i listen to tutorials about web components everyone is saying
"try not to think about it as react components"
"working with scoped css is terrible"
Guess what i did?

* i need to check if image container have a sibling and if so remove some classes.

if only child - render stuff with all them classes
if sibling - only the image-box

<section class="about">
<div class=".about__about-container">
// image needs these container classes to look proper
// text box need these container classes to look proper
// if there is both an image and a textbox, there should be only one about and about-container class
</div>
</section>

there is a super simple answer to this. i know it. but brain is mushy and i am stupid. Thats ok. i should go for a run
and thing about it.

wait. should i have to include if image should be placed in a box. right now an image cant be shown without a box
but if img attribute already gives a box, it be redundant to add img and boxes as attributes. will also ruin !boxes rule
* should check for children or siblings

element.firstChild
or
element.hasChildNodes()

if  element.childNodes.length <= 1 set boxesTemp (.about__about-container ) to #conditionalDiv then add whatever.
else just add proper template.
i guess !boxes or !img attributes should do the trick to diffrentiate between if an image is added or text.

-this doesnt scale at all. attributes dont make much sense. but i guess there shouldve been different kinds of
costum elements originally to make it make more sense. but you dumbed it down remember? dont make the same mistake again.
eyes on the prices (the price in this case is the same price as "play stupid games, win stupid prices").

i will name this project "how to pwn yourself 101"
