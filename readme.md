*did the original design in figma, strongly based (copied) from old Mac OS 9 i grew up with.  


* i need to rethink my BEM-classes again, should i think more in components?
should i start to try to make em right away before it goes too far. or do everything first.
probably not the latter. ill get to it soon



What am i using ChatGPT for?
//used chatGPT to ask about BEM since i get confused on how long the class names are suppose to be, how far nested?
//used chatGPT to get mediequeries for mobile first because i forgot the syntax.
//used chatGPT to properly use flex grow/shrink to get right element to resize
//using chatGPT a lot to get all the values for a property,i understand it better than MDN.
// asked the bot how to properly set flex on children to make em take up equal amount of space of its container


ideas
// could i do a vanilla js webcomponent? 

// can i get the rearange feature in the bottom right of the window, but only on desktop.
im guessing i need to do some x-pos y-pos with javascript to drag em around. should it push the other content
or should it overlap. i need to think about it.
id really like if one feature would be that if you expand one of the windows, ive hidden easter eggs off screen.

// should the expand button make the window collapse at place itself on top of upper window?
// should it work by placing it with position:relative top:0, or do i have to use javascript to find the lower boundingrect?
