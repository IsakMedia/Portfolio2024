                TL;DR: A middle aged balding guy who is strangely still curious about life. He likes scss,  accessibility, javascript and A.I. 
                <br>( I asked an A.I to shorten my text for me and it did a really good job. But i thought this was funnier)

                Hello, Iâ€™m a middle-aged, balding guy who, surprise to surprise, is aiming to be a developer. Some (my degree) may say I already am. Either way, I am a natural creative, an unnatural designer, and a born-again coder, who value play a lot. It is important for me that at least some of my life has space for play, of any kind. Itâ€™s what makes coding especially exciting to me. Itâ€™s like a new toy or tool that extends my creative outlet. Iâ€™m really happy to have it under my belt, even though that might be an overstatement ðŸ™‚ (Dunning-Kruger called and wanted their imposter syndrome back).

                In my studies, we covered the core basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. We also dipped our toes into UX and had a day each in the Adobe Suite and Figma. Post-graduation, Iâ€™m diving deeper into vanilla JavaScript, trying to understand how things work under the hood of features you get right of the bat from the next cool new JS framework.

                I believe itâ€™s important in life not to reinvent the wheel all the time, but to build on the progress of others, keeping up to speed while being efficient and practical about work. At the same time, allow yourself to stay curious about how the wheel works and why it spins.
            </p>

                AI, for example, is a great tool and will help a lot. Fighting it would be both unreasonable and counterproductive. Instead, ask it to help you understand. Be curious about it and be cautious about the things it can do that might lead to unwanted results. You can do your daughter's homework, or you can discuss her homework with her and finish it together. Exercise that brain. I will ask ChatGPT to shorten this text after Iâ€™m done and see if it can make it sound more professional. Iâ€™ll value its input but keep hold of things that show my personality and the tone I want to convey.

                Talk to me professionally about UX design, SCSS, and accessibility, AI, and animation. AR/VR would be super cool to work on someday too.

                Talk to me personally about movies, skateboarding, animation, new technology, and the future.
